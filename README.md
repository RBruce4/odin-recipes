This current project, I believe, will help my understand how to set up
and link multiple pages in a project. I'm sure I'll have an index and at
least a few different recipees which will call for relative links between
pages. I'm sure I'll also be adding images and lists to assist with the 
structure of the pages themselves. Ultimately I hope to acheive a navigable
page with a few recipees that will be useful, albeit ugly for now.
