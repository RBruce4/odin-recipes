    <p>A very simple spaghetti and meat sauce recipe that is quick, cheap, and
    delicious. First you'll need:</p>
    <ul class="lists">
        <li>1 to 2 lbs of ground beef, I prefer 80/20</li>
        <li>1 package of spaghetti noodles</li>
        <li>1 jar of your favorite spaghetti sauce</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now that we have our ingredients, we start the super simple process. 
        It should take no more than 20 minutes or so. </p>
    <ol class="lists">
        <li>Bring a pot of water to boil. While it's heading up, add a couple 
            tablespoons of olive oil, and a teaspoon or so of salt to the 
            water. Once boiling, add some noodles and stir frequently. You 
            won't need the whole box, around half should work fine.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile start heating a saucepan to medium heat. Once hot, brown
            the ground beef.</li>
        <li>Now that the ground beef is sufficiently cooked, drain the 
            exceess oil with a collinder. </li>
        <li>Return the beef to the pan and reduce the heat to low. Pour
            in the spaghetti sauce and bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally.
        </li>
        <li>Around this time the noodles should be done, the easiest way to tell
            is to pull one out and taste it! If they are done, drain the water
            with the collinder, and return them to the pan. 
        </li>
        <li>Once the sauce is bubbling a bit everything is ready. Give it a final 
            stir and check the temperature to make sure it's hot enough.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>To serve, put some noodles on the plate, and the sauce on top. You can
        sprinkle parmesan cheese to add flavor as well. Alternatively, you can 
        premix the sauce with all the noodles in the pot and serve it that 
        way. It's up to you! I typically make some sort of breadsticks or 
        garlic knots with this meal, and since I'm usually trying to keep it 
        quick, frozen breadsticks work great!<br>
        Enjoy!
